#### Idea
My idea is to incorporate a [**Click To Buy**](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ndhx3cipncm4yjt/Was%20It%20Right.mp3?dl=0&m=)  button, into musicians posts, that will enable them to sell their music internally inside their Steemit Blog. This will be in the form of a **Buy It Now** button or similar to the current **Promote and Boost**  buttons with a direct downloadable file link inside the wallet. Just to make it clear that, this will only be available to artists that create **Original Music** to avoid any confusion.

#### Proposal

I'd like to create a Standalone player, where the artists back catalogue is added to and stored automatically each time they post a new track in their Steemit blog.  Within the musicians wallet, will be a 'Click to Buy' button with a bespoke price set by the artist. The listener/music fan can buy the track directly with either Steem or SBD - which is then paid directly to the artists Steemit wallet.  When the artist creates a blog music post with DSound, Dtube or Dlive - they will have the option to upload the MP3 of the song too, which will be stored centrally within their wallet.

#### Mockups / Examples -
 
There are various digital download sites that have this feature already built in and have been successfully enabling the music artist to sell their music for the past 10 years or so. With the birth of Steemit and it's increasing off shoots, I believe this will be a great way for the artist to gain more revenue.

As an example, here's a site I've recently been testing to see how it would work on Steemit.
It has a simplistic UI and would work really well on the Steemit platform.
SwiftDemand is a new token similar in nature to many other decentralized crypto-currencies.
I set the price at 150 Swift for each track and 600 Swift for the 5 track EP - that saves the consumer 150 Swift by choosing the complete EP.

Ok, this next part is not a shameless self marketing/promotion stunt, it is to merely demonstration the simplicity of the music buying process.
This is taken from my recent blog post, where I am now successfully receiving small donations of Steem and SBD for my EP. It is working and I now feel like it needs developing and moving forwards.

Check out my  Blog Post [Here](https://steemit.com/steem-music/@darrenclaxton/have-you-heard-my-5-track-ep-never-grow-old-yet-download-for-steem-or-sbd)
This gives you an idea of the work I put in just to add direct Dropbox links for each track.

*You can download the tracks individually if you prefer. Please donate what you can to my [Steemit Wallet](https://steemit.com/@darrenclaxton/transfers) This will enable me to carry on producing more material.*
*Thanks kindly.*

#### Benefits

Once I find someone to write the code for my idea and put it into practice on the platform, I feel that it will be of great benefit to us independent musicians on the Steemit blockchain.

So, what do you think fellow artists? 

Thanks for reading my idea and please do not hesitate to contact me to discuss it further.
